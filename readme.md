# Fetchr Analytics add-on
This is an add-on for a Minecraft bingo datapack created by <name>! It aims to log all the succesful runs and several statistics associated with those runs. These will be stored in a database (MariaDB) and the stats can be seen in a custom web application or simplefied data in discord.

# Road-map
- [ ] Store all run information in a database (MariaDB)
